Changes since version 0.1

- Added some optimizations which should save memory when large numbers of 
  scripts are loaded.

- Added the HTTP module which includes convenience functions: redirect(), 
  auth_required() and string_answer().

- Added preliminary Pike Server Pages support. Files with a .psp extension 
  will be parsed according to the PSP markup specification (which is 
  currently evolving.) See README.PSP for more information.
