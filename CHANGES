Changes since version 0.4

- Generalized the runner interface.
- Added -p option to specify a listen port
- Moved to Tools.Logging for logging
- Added SCGI support

Changes since version 0.3

- More comprehensive Apache documentation.
- Simple installation instructions in INSTALL.
- Added configuration script and a simple Makefile for installing
  ScriptRunner. 
- Added option for storing session data in a RAM or SQLite database. The
  SQLite option requires the Sql.Provider.SQLite module. Choose the 
  session storage method by setting the session_storagetype variable
  to one of "file", "ram" or "sqlite". The default is RAM, though for 
  installations which involve multiple simultaneous instances of 
  ScriptRunner, either "file" or "sqlite" storage will be necessary.

Changes since version 0.2

- Added "use-session" directive to allow a PSP page to participate
  in a session. Note that this can only be specified once per file
  (Limitation in our current PSP parser).

- Added HTTP.set_cookie()

- Initial session support is here, only supports standard encodable
  Pike datatypes, enable with: __participates_in_session in script 
  object.

- Added Session Manager objects

- Added simple file based session engine, no session expiration yet!

- Added baseclass, ScriptRunner.SRPikeScript to contain all standard
  methods and fields.

- Added appropriate locking to keep multithreaded applications happy.

- Simplified returning of data within the app itself, added method 
  response_write_and_finish() to allow direct access to writing responses.

- Added <%@ handling

- added "include" directive, with absolute paths chrooted to document root.

- added filename to generated code, should provide better error messages as 
  a result.

- fixed line numbering, so it should be more accurate.

- fixed bug that caused the first TextBlock in a parse session to be 
  silently dropped.

Changes since version 0.1

- Added some optimizations which should save memory when large numbers of 
  scripts are loaded.

- Added the HTTP module which includes convenience functions: redirect(), 
  auth_required() and string_answer().

- Added preliminary Pike Server Pages support. Files with a .psp extension 
  will be parsed according to the PSP markup specification (which is 
  currently evolving.) See README.PSP for more information.
