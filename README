Subject: [caudium-general] [Annouce] Pike ScriptRunner FastCGI

Greetings!

In yet another in a long string of rapid-fire ideas turned into alpha
quality code, I'd like to annouce the availability of the Pike
ScriptRunner. ScriptRunner is a FastCGI application that will
(hopefully) run under pretty much any web server that supports FastCGI.
The ScriptRunner allow you to run pike scripts under non-pike based web
servers. Because ScriptRunner uses FastCGI, its performance should be
close to embedded language solutions like mod_perl, but with a lot
less worries about security and overflows. With ScriptRunner you can
introduce all of your friends to Pike without forcing them to suffer
bad performance or the (more likely) attachment to Apache. In addition,
ScriptRunner does a lot of the unpleasant work of parsing incoming
requests, allowing you to get right to the task of writing your code.

Right now, it's pretty early on in its development, so there are a lot of
niceties present in Roxen or Caudium that aren't available, and it's not
terribly well tested, so it could have some nasty bugs. Enough raw
functionality is available to be highly useful; hopefully there will be
interest in improving things in this area. ScriptRunner contains code
written by others over the years; this is really more of a gathering of
snippets into something more readily useful to others.

Requirements:

Pike 7.6+
libfastcgi (available from http://www.fastcgi.com)
Public.Web.FastCGI (available from
http://www.siriushosting.com/pike/fastcgi.html)

Features:

- Multi-threaded request handling
- Compiled object caching
- Incoming requests are parsed and passed to you in a request id object.
- Handles FCGI processing for you. Just return a string or control mapping
  from your parse() method.

Installation:

Get the snapshot tarball here:

http://buoy.riverweb.com:8080/viewrep/cvs/scriptrunner

Some example scripts are included to give you a head start. Simply copy
the scriptrunner files to a FastCGI enabled web server. Edit the
scriptrunner application to specify an optional log file (recommended).
Add a redirect to convert all requests to (*.pike) to
/path/to/scriptrunner.fcgi($1) (actual syntax will vary based on the
redirector you're using.

Comments, Feedback and Participation:

I welcome all of these, especially if you're interested in helping to
debug and enhance the code. Contact me if you'd like to help out.

Best regards,

Bill
